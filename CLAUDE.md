## Debugging checklist

Before proposing code changes to fix pytest failures, import errors, or
unexpected "unrecognised arguments" / plugin-loading errors, ask:

> "Have you reinstalled the package recently? (`pip install -e .`)"

A stale or broken editable install has caused confusing errors that looked
like conftest loading problems but were actually just a missing package.
