# Microclaw — Claude Instructions

## Git workflow

- Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- For any new work, create a branch named `florian/<short-description>`.
- Before starting new work, pull the latest `main` and rebase the feature branch onto it.
- Run any existing tests before committing.
- When work is ready, push the branch and open a pull request with `gh pr create` instead of merging directly.

## Debugging checklist

Before proposing code changes to fix pytest failures, import errors, or
unexpected "unrecognised arguments" / plugin-loading errors, ask:

> "Have you reinstalled the package recently? (`pip install -e .`)"

A stale or broken editable install has caused confusing errors that looked
like conftest loading problems but were actually just a missing package.

## Micro-Manager ZMQ bridge (pyjavaz)

Never call `JavaClass("some.Class")` directly for **static** access. pyjavaz
caches every static-class shadow under one key (`"java.lang.Class"`), so the
first class wrapped in the process wins and later ones silently expose *its*
static methods — an order-dependent bug that passes in isolation and fails in a
full run (`AttributeError: 'java_lang_Class' object has no attribute '<method>'`).

Route all static `JavaClass` through `controller._new_static_java_class(port,
classpath)`, which evicts the colliding cache key first. `JavaObject`
(instances) is unaffected. See design/12 for the full trace.

Field access and method access use **different naming conventions** over the
bridge. A Java object's **public fields** keep their raw camelCase name —
`sp.numAxes`, NOT `sp.num_axes` (the snake_case version silently returns wrong
data / drops axes; it does not error). Static **methods**, by contrast, are
snake_cased — `create2_d`, `create1_d`. So: fields = camelCase, methods =
snake_case.
